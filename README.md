# FIB-DS-Ethereum-SmartContracts

## Description
Lab solution in course Decentralized Systems, FIB UPC - Leonard Halling and Aksel Vincent Berg.\

As the scope of the lab description states, we will implement and evaluate a Decentralized Application [*dApp*]. The dApp that is going to be made is a **Lottery System** built upon **Smart Contracts**, deployed on the **Ethereum Platform**.

## Smart Contract Lottery
### Rules
A generic description of the smart contract lottery system.

* Each player inputs certain amount of Ether in the lottery.
* When the lottery cap has been reached, the lottery will start.
* Thereâ€™s a limit of how much Ether one participant can insert.
* The chances of winning is based on the amount of Ether inserted by each participant.
* When the winner has been decided, the winnings will be rewarded to the winner, and the other participants will be notified that the game has ended.
